# Kickstarter Crowdfunding Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project was an analysis of a Kickstarter campaign dataset and the final outcomes.  The purpose was to drill into the dataset to find similar theater projects as Louise's project
and analyze factors that contribute to the success or failure of the campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Our first objective was to look at campaigns in the Theater Category and analyze the outcomes based on the month that the campaign launched.  Although, a large number of campaigns were 
launched in the second quarter, for the most part the percentage success rate hovered between 50-65% for every month.  There is not a significant conclusion I can make  
to what month to launch in as I felt the rate of success was pretty evenly spread over the months and there wasn't a great difference in the success rates for any given month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Play campaigns had the highest level of success if their goal was under $5,000, with almost 70% of campaigns being under this level.  
As the goal amount increased, the failure rate did as well.  There was an uptick in success at the $35,000-$45,000 campaign goal level but very 
limited numbers of campaigns to analyze so it could be a bit of an outlier.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The chart we created for outcomes based on launch date could have been a misleading chart because it makes it look as if May was a very successful month. 
However, if you do some further calculations on percent success rates, you find it is similar to the other months.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1.  The month a campaign is launched in does not make much of a difference on success.  The majority of months, campaigns met their goal amount 50-65% of the time.
2.  The worst quarter was the 4th quarter with a success rate of 56%.  The best quarter was the 2nd quarter with a success rate of 65%.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Louise's campaign goal of $10,000 is high compared to similar play campaigns.  She may have a better chance of success if she were able to cut her goal in half.
With her goal amount of $10,000 she would have a 50% chance of success compared to similar campaigns.  


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Other than average donation, we don't have a lot of statistics on the donation amounts so it is hard to know the spread of donation amounts and if a few high dollar
donations led to the success of campaigns.  Having the median donation amount would have been helpful to know how spread out donation amounts were.  I also had to make the assumption
that all goal amounts had been converted to US Dollars since some campaigns in this dataset were from other countries.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I calculated average success rate by month for subcategory Plays and that led me to the conclusion that the success rate didn't vary much by month.
